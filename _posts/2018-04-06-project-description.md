### Title
Evaluate all the characteristics that designers consider in forming the Aesthetics of a residential building. Some of the list of characteristics are: Open Plan, Isolated, etc

#### Spatio-Temporal property of Aesthetics
In case you need to map the association between Open Plan and an Isolated Space, the spatio-temporal properties of the Open Plan layout, the Association and the Isolated Space need to be considered. Decision making in terms of the architecture of the building comes in 5 realms:

    - Orientation
    - Circulation
    - Landscaping
    - Building Materials
    - Aesthetics

Out of these realms, the project considers:

    - Light
    - Circulation
    - Retention

#### Open Plan
An open plan space is formed from the result of adjoined bounded areas where there is maximised circulation, minimsed separation walls, maximised retention of people aligned with the purpose of the house. 

#### Isolated
An isolated space solves the purpose of the house by removing the conflicting information from the plan. While creating an isolated area, it must be made sure that the reason for retention inside must not be mixed with any other connected areas. In implementing the requirement, there must be a method to identify whether the isolation has been implementing successfully.

### Motivation
The motivation is to understand the relationships between the bounded areas in terms of three main factors:
    (1) Circulation
    (2) Light
    (3) Retention

### Examples

Circulation
-----------
The greater the probability to displace the amount of air from a particular area under consideration implies there is better circulation. The inertia in displacing the air due to the provision of doors and windows enables better circulation.

* The line at the left hand side denotes a window, the line at the bottom is another window and there is a door at the right hand side. The video explains the expelling of air based on responsibility assignment at each point in space.

Light
-----
The scattering property of light must be made use by the separating walls and the bounded areas effectively such that light is available for casual seeing and ordinary tasks. 

* There are two windows and a door as demostrated. The light varies as the position of the window varies, the animation displays how relevant the requirement is based on light scattered at each point in space. Here every point is designated an allowable value and there must be a deviation of the intensity of light across all the points because every point is either positively or negatively classified for light and there exists a dependence derivative that relates to the desired requirement.

Retention
---------
The property of retention is dependent on the degree of freedom availabel at each point of the bounded area. The greater it is closer to the nearest wall the lesser the retention value will be. How this is important is that each bounded area can be designated as +ve or -ve retaining based on the purpose of the design. An aggregated value that denotes the retention is dependent on the separating walls, the area and the location.

* Maximising the retention, minimises the movement of people within the area under consideration. The aim of this section is to analyse the purpose has been solved.
